Leia Parental Control is a parental control system for children.

I use this for my own child and it is working well for my own needs.
It is however a work in progress and is not ready for public consumption.

If you are a Javascript programmer feel free to improve it to your own requirements.
The whole source of the application is here : https://github.com/paganaye/leia-parental-control

I am happy to reply to questions.
